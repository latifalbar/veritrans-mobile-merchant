# Reference Merchant Server for Veritrans Mobile SDK

This is a testing server for the development of Veritrans Mobile SDK. 
Also acts as a reference implementation for the methods to be implemented by merchants to use the mobile SDK.

This is alternative implementation of official [Mobile-Merchant-Server](https://github.com/veritrans/mobile-merchant-server) in Go.

## Implementation

Testing server will provide two different API endpoint for `Sandbox` and `Production` build.

- `Sandbox` will use `/api` endpoint group.
- `Production` will use `/api-prod` endpoint group.

Each endpoint group will have several function which needed to run by Veritrans Mobile SDK.

### Charge Payment

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/charge`
- **Headers**:
    - Content-Type  : `application/json`
    - Accept        : `application/json`
    - Authorization : `Basic ` + Base64(__VT-Server-Key__)
- **Request**: All Veritrans supported payment details. Read more at [Veritrans Documentation Website](http://docs.veritrans.co.id/en/api/methods.html#Charge).
- **Response**: Should be same as the response from Veritrans Payment API. Read more at [Veritrans Documentation Website](http://docs.veritrans.co.id/en/api/methods.html#Charge).

This endpoint will be used to charge payment to Veritrans Payment API. Basically the implementation of this endpoint just add `Authorization` in the header using `Server Key` which is required to do the charging and then do a HTTP call to Veritrans Payment API. The response of the HTTP call should be passed back as the response of this endpoint.

### Promotions

To handle promotion, there are several endpoint to be implemented.

#### Add a Discount Promo

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/promotions/discount`
- **Headers**
    - Admin-Token: __MERCHANT_ADMIN_TOKEN__
- **Request**

    ```
    {
        "title": "Installment Title",
        "description": "Installment description",
        "discount_percentage": 35,
        "bins": [
            "52111"
        ],
        "installment_terms": [
            "6"
        ]
    }
    ```

- **Response**

    ```
    {
      "status_code" : 201,
      "status_message" : "Discount created."
    }
    ```

#### Remove a Discount Promo

        "title": "Discount Title",
        "description": "Discount description",
        "discount_percentage": 35,
        "bins": [
            "52111"
        ]
    }
    ```

#### Get Promotions List

- **Endpoint** : `GET /api/promotions`
- **Response** :

    ```
    {
        "data": {
            "installment": [
                INSTALLMENT_OBJECT,
                INSTALLMENT_OBJECT
            ],
            "discount": [
                DISCOUNT_OBJECT,
                DISCOUNT_OBJECT
            ]
        },
        "status_code": 200,
        "status_message": "success"
    }
    ```

### Save Card

Mobile SDK enables the user to save their card credential in a token that can be saved so it can be used later.

So merchant server needs to provide endpoint to Save card, get card list and remove card.

#### Save Card

- **Endpoint** : `POST /api/card/register`
- **Request**

    ```
    {
        "status_code" : "200",
        "masked_card" : "481111-14",
        "saved_token_id" : "4ioasfaslk490asfakj"
    }
    ```
    
- **Response**

    ```
    {
        "status_code" : 201,
        "status_message" : "Card is saved."
    }
    ```

#### Get Card List

- **Endpoint** : "GET /api/card"
- **Headers**
    - X-Auth : __Authentication-Token__
- **Response**

    ```
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "saved_token_id": "4ioasfaslk490asfakj",
          "masked_card": "481111-14"
        }
      ],
      "status_code": 200,
      "status_message": "Success"
    }
    ```

#### Remove Card

## Credentials

You need to use your own Veritrans credential provided in MAP.

In `merchant.go` you need to change these variables.

```
// Sandbox Token
var Token = "VT-server-MFoCwh-MkpoSlOMdqiWCx9WB"

// Production Token
var ProductionToken = "VT-server-nt-LofCmn8UhgUcK8T8Za2ep"
```
